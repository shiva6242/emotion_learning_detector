# 🎓 Emotion-Based Learning Difficulty Detector

A real-time deep learning application that analyzes **facial emotions from a webcam** and maps them to **learning difficulty states**.  
Built using **CNN, TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Streamlit**.

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end Deep Learning workflow**:
dataset → training → model saving → real-time deployment.

## 🧠 Learning Difficulty Mapping

| Emotion   | Learning State |
|----------|----------------|
| Angry    | Frustrated – Needs support |
| Disgust  | Disengaged – Needs attention |
| Fear     | Confused – Needs clarification |
| Sad      | Low motivation – Needs encouragement |
| Happy    | Engaged – Learning well |
| Surprise | Curious – Actively learning |
| Neutral  | Normal – Average engagement |
